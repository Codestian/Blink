# Blink 

A simple Minecraft Fabric mod which adds blinking as a game mechanic. If you are playing on multiplayer, it needs to be installed on both client and server.

## How it works

With the default configuration, an automatic blink occurs every 10-15 seconds. 
If you would like to manually close and open your eyes, press and hold the `r` key.

Staring at an enderman with eyes closed will not turn it hostile, similar to wearing Jack o'Lanterns.

The animation duration, and range of time the blink occurs can be configured in `blinkconfig.properties`.
